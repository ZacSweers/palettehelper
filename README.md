Palette Helper is a simple utility app made to generate color palettes of images using Google's fantastic [Palette](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html) library.

The flow is pretty simple. You can either choose to open an image from storage, or take one from your camera (if you feel like capturing a scene). You can also share an image with the app via the system's intent system.

For fun, I opted to write this all in Kotlin. Assuming you install the Kotlin plugin, this should be easy to import and run in Android Studio.

Special thanks to [@emilsjolander](https://github.com/emilsjolander) for the icon/graphic designs!
